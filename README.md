# Node.js Server Unexpectedly Closing Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Node.js HTTP server unexpectedly closes without any apparent errors in the logs.  The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

A simple HTTP server, created using the `http` module, unexpectedly terminates after a period of inactivity or after handling a specific number of requests.  The server doesn't provide any error messages or logs before closing. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the server's event loop is kept alive, even during periods of inactivity.  This is achieved by employing techniques like setting `keepAlive` to `true` (though note that this is not guaranteed to resolve all similar issues) or using a more robust framework like Express.js which is better at managing these circumstances.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node server.js`.
3. Make a few requests to the server (e.g., using `curl`).
4. Wait for a period of inactivity. The server may unexpectedly close.  Note that this might be a non-deterministic bug, so you might need multiple attempts.
